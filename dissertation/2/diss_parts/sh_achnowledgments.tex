\chapter*{\label{acknowledgments}Acknowledgments}


I would like to gratefully acknowledge the supervision of my advisor, Dr. Binoy Ravindran
during my Ph.D. study, for his enthusiasm, and his great efforts to guide my research from the start.

Many thanks to the rest of my committee: Dr. Robert P. Broadwater, Dr. Cameron D. Patterson, Dr. Mohamed R. Rizk, and Dr. Anil Vullikanti for their invaluable advice and comments during my preliminary and defence exams. It is a great honour to have them serving in my committee.


In addition, I would like to thank all my previous and current colleagues in Real-Time Systems Laboratory, who provided my great environment for collaboration and discussion. Their warm suggestions and help made me never feel alone in this long journey.


Last but not least, thank all my family members for their love and support. I am grateful to
my parents, who always did their best in supporting my education from the childhood, and suggested me the correct direction to make my dream come true. Also, I thank my dear wife who devoted her love and support to me through the ups and downs over the past years. It is difficult to overstate my gratitude to her for being such a wonderful wife.


This dissertation is dedicated to all the people who helped me and are helping me all the
way.
