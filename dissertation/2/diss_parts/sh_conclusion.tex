\textbf{From chapter\ref{ecm-rcm}}

Our work raises several questions.  
For example, what are the typical range of values for the different parameters that affect the retry cost (and hence the response time)? How tight is our retry and response time bounds in practice? Can real-time CMs be designed for other multicore real-time schedulers (e.g., partitioned, semi-partitioned), and those that dynamically improve application timeliness behavior? These are important directions for further work.
