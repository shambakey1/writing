<font color="green">[Abstract]</font><br>
We consider software transactional memory (STM) concurrency control for 
embedded multicore real-time software, and present a novel contention 
manager for resolving transactional conflicts, called PNF. We upper 
bound transactional retries and task response times. Our implementation 
in RSTM/real-time Linux reveals that PNF yields shorter or comparable 
retry costs than competitors.
