Here it is. 


Comments:
- I have read and edited the new sections. 
- I found numerous errors elsewhere in the paper (e.g., sentences ending without a period)! You better proof-read the whole paper carefully
- I have been able to save you almost half a column of space. Use this judiciously -- maybe include one additional plot
- At many places, you say "...is given by Theorem X in [Y]." Is that really necessary, as opposed to ".....is given in [Y]"? (Recall EMSOFT comments)
- When referring to an equation, say "...is given by (X)..." as opposed to "...given as (X)..."


Fix all and submit.
