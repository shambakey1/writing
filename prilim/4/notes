- The abstract is too long. It must be condensed into a page or so and must focus on:
a) the thesis problem space in 1 paragraph
b) the current contributions in 2 (maybe 3, but not recommended) paragraphs
c) proposed post-exam work in 1 paragraph

- The Intro is very immature and too condensed. Preliminaries and models must NOT be in the Intro, but must be in a separate chapter. Infact, I suggest that you use Section 1 of your SAC and DATE papers as the material for the Intro, but significantly expanded, especially explaining TM (see Mohamedin's section 1.1).

- Related work chapter is too condensed. You classify works (and discuss them) in the following categories:
a) locking protocols
b) lock-free
c) database
d) TM

- TM overview should not be in the Related work chapter!

- Chapter 3 should be models/assumptions

Editorial-type comments:
- It is awkward to format proofs in italics
- How come you have sections 1.0.1 in Ch 1? Ch 1 sections should be 1.1, 1.2, etc. Looks like wrong usage of latex section command.

- Advisor proof-editing. Usually, students give the exam document to the advisor for editing and correcting 1-week before the deadline for giving to the draft committee, which is 1-week before the exam. You have blown that deadline, so I am not sure whether I can edit and correct your work with sufficient lead time for you to correct, etc., and then forward to the committee.

I don't think you are ready for the exam, and suggest that you postpone the exam. You can alert the GS, and I can e-mail the committee. Thanks.

Mohammed,

Go ahead and start on this asap, and thoroughly address all my comments that I had sent you previously. (FYI, I include an outline below. This is the same as what I had discussed before.)

The key is to get your Abstract, Intro, and Concl chapters right. I suggest that you send me each of these three, in a piecemeal fashion -- that way, I can respond fast. (The rest of the chapters must follow the outline that I had suggested. I have reviewed them anyway, as part of your papers.)

Be sure to incorporate Emsoft results. 

I am very busy this week, with many other submissions. Plan to send me stuff starting Mon/Tues or so.
